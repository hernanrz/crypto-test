# def rant
# p "Why are bitcoin (cash) developers such a bunch of math nerds?
# We'll never know
# Like seriously, they pick the weirdest stuff
# BCH Codes? One might expect BCH there to mean "bitcoin cash" because that's what we're working with here
# But no, it stands for Bose-Chaudhuriâ€“Hocquenghem Codes
# Which is basically a super complicated way of doing error correction
# seriously, it's like they hate new developers
# Have you read their (bitcoin cash) spec documents? Those things are plagued with unexplained acronyms everywhere"

# def tip
# For all the dumb devs like me, these videos helped me understand (a bit) the whole cyclic code business
